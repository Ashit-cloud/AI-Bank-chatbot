- - What are the things that I should look for before applying for a personal loan?
  - A few things that you should consider when applying for a personal loan are as follows:-
- - How can I reduce the EMI payable for a personal loan?
  - You can reduce the EMI for a personal loan by improving/maintaining a credit score over 750. If you have a good relationship with the bank, you can negotiate for a better interest rate or a relationship discount.
- - is pre-payment allowed for personal loans?
  - Certain lenders may allow you To pre-pay the loan amount, based on their respective terms and conditions. it is likely that you will be charged a pre-payment fee. Thus, if you intend To pre-pay your loan during the loan tenure, make sure To check if your lender allows this.
- - Why is it important to have a good credit score?
  - If you have a good credit score, the chances of you being offered the loan at a low interest rate are quite high. Your credit score indicates your creditworthiness and your repayment ability. If you are looking to apply for a personal loan, it is advisable to maintain a credit score that is over 750. Individuals with a very low credit score may be denied a loan altogether, while those with a moderate credit score may be offered a personal loan, but at a high interest rate.
- - How long do lenders take To disburse the loan amount?
  - if you Are a pre-approved customer, the loan amount will be disbursed To your account quickly. if you Are applying through offline channels, you will need To submit the required documents and wait for your loan request To be approved, post which you will receive the loan amount. if you apply through third-party financial services websites like BankBazaar.com, your loan amount will be disbursed in a timely manner once your application is approved.
- - How is my loan eligibility calculated?
  - Personal loan is a 1-5 year unsecured loan given by banks, NBFC’s (Non Banking Finance Companies) or P2P lending platforms without asking for any collateral, guarantor or hypothecation of any assets. The ultimate usage of a personal loan is left to the discretion of the borrower. In our experience, the borrowers generally use a personal loan for debt consolidation, repaying high cost debt, meeting any family or medical emergency, wedding, vacations, home renovation, rental deposits, business needs for an SME, buying certain assets etc.
- - My loan got rejected even though I have a decent salary package?
  - Loan eligibility is dependent on primarily the following factors:-
      The company where you work. Every bank has a list of companies running into thousands which they have categorised into segments like A, B, C etc depending on the credentials and financials of your employer. The higher the category the higher is the loan eligibility chances.
      Quantum of loans and credit card outstanding that you already have. Typically a bank will not give a loan if the total EMI obligation (including the current personal loan that your are trying to apply for) exceeds 50-75% of your total net take home salary.
      Your gross/net salary
      Your credit score as reflected in your CIBIL or Equifax report. Having a good credit score is a necessary but not a sufficient criteria.
- - Pre Closure vs part- prepayment?
  - The final decision to grant a loan lies with the credit department of a bank. Some of the reasons why a loan can be rejected are:-
      Possible Issue:-
        Already running several loans and hence a bank may not be comfortable with your existing leverage levels vis-a-vis your salary level.
      Possible Way Out:-
        If you have a spouse who is also working, you can add her as a co-applicant to boost the combined salary levels or
        Try to pay off some of your debt so that your leverage levels can come down or
        Do a balance transfer/debt consolidation/re-financing of your existing loans such that the rate of interest on loans can also come down and additional loan can also be provided.
      Possible Issue:-
        Issues in your credit history as reflected in your CIBIL, Equifax reports
      Possible way out:-
        If the issue is a minor one like some delay in payment of credit card due then we can try your application in some other bank who can possibly take a lenient view on the deviation
        If you think that the credit report is erroneous and you have sufficient documentary proof we will represent the case to the bank and try to convince the credit team
        If the issue is a major one like write off, settlement of any past dues etc then it might be difficult to obtain a loan. Certain mitigation factor like if you/your spouse/your parents have an own house in India can give comfort to certain banks to give you a loan.
      Possible Issue:-
        Most banks have certain internal credit parameters to evaluate a loan which is kept confidential and not shared with us. Several demographic, financial and credit aspects go into these internal evaluation. You might not have met the minimum cut off for obtaining a loan.
      Possible way out:-
        We can re-apply for your loan in one of the other 10 plus lenders that we are affiliated to.
